Ideas to go with:

1.      Display current score where the highscore starts at 1 and equals the amout of moonies eaten.

2.      Create a highscore storage (probably in a txt file) so that one can try to beat the highscore.

3.      Change the fckn gameover box....

4.      Add special events: 
        -   probably something like random lgbt+ moonies to collect and make a rainbow snake for x seconds
        -   random e-cigarettes to collect that changes papa heads into vaping papa dragon heads

5.      Background music:
        -   mp3 of ragnar singing flymetothemoon
        -   maybe playlists 
        -   ELVIS 60's songs =)
